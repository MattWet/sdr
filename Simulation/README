## Overview
This is the accompanying README file of the simulation
of the paper Stagewise Boosting Distributional Regression.

## Table of Contents Computation of Simulation
- bash/R/R: array_job_NO.sh / array_job_NO.R / sim_NO.R
- bash/R/R: array_job_gamma.sh / array_job_gamma.R / sim_gamma.R
- bash/R/R: array_job_ZANBI.sh / array_job_ZANBI.R / sim_ZANBI.R

## Usage Computation of Simulation
For each distribution we have a triplet of scripts to execute the corresponding simulation settings.
For example: bash/R/R: array_job_NO.sh / array_job_NO.R / sim_NO.R, the bash script array_job_NO.sh
specifies the HPC-resources (that depend on the specific simulation setting) and sources the first
R script array_job_NO.R, which is mainly used for processing input variables of the first script.
In turn the second script sources the last script sim_NO.R which executes the simulation.
The usage is to qsub the first script with additional variables which specify the exact setting
of the simulation to the HPC cluster:
```bash
qsub array_job_NO 500 100 7
```
In above example, 100 replications of the NO setting with 500 observations, 100 noise variables
and rho = 0.7 are executed. The different suffixes _NO, _gamma, _ZANBI are for the corresponding
distributions and run for 100 replications.
